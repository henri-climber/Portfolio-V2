          Hey there, I'm Henri, a tech enthusiast from  Germany. I've been coding for four years and just started studying Physics at TUM in Munich. 
          I started by creating little 2D games with Pygame and am now working on data science projects and my startup. 
          Last year, I participated in two big Hackathons, Junctions and START Hack,  which were both fantastic. 
          I can't wait to compete at more Hackathons in the future.</p>

        <div className="about-me">
          <img className="img2" src={henriClimbImg} alt="Henri" />
          <p>
          Beyond programming and academics, I'm passionate about climbing, especially as a competitive sport. I've competed at the 
          national level for nine years and internationally. Competitive climbing has taught me resilience, strategy, and 
          focusâ€”skills that have been helpful both in my studies and my everyday life.
